        <h2>
          Bella will thrive in a home with plenty of space to play and a loving
          family to give her the attention she needs. Whether you have children,
          other pets, or live an active lifestyle, Bella is adaptable and will
          fit right in. Her sociable and well-behaved nature makes her an
          excellent choice for first-time dog owners as well Health & Care:
          Bella is in excellent health. She has been fully vaccinated, regularly
          dewormed, and is up to date on all her medical check-ups. She has a
          clean bill of health from the vet and is ready for adoption.
        </h2>
        <h1>Feeding:</h1>
        <h2>
          Bella enjoys a balanced diet of high-quality dog food and occasional
          healthy treats. Her favorite treats include carrots and peanut
          butter-filled chew toys. It's important to keep her meals consistent
          to maintain her health and energy levels.
        </h2>
        <h1>Exercise Needs</h1>
        <h2>
          Being an active dog, Bella requires daily exercise to keep her fit and
          mentally stimulated. She enjoys long walks, playing fetch, and even
          swimming when possible. A daily walk of at least 30-45 minutes,
          combined with some playtime in the yard or park, will keep her happy
          and healthy
        </h2>
        <h1>Grooming</h1>
        <h2>

          exception. She will require regular brushing to prevent her fur from
          matting and to reduce shedding. Occasional baths, nail trimming, and
          ear cleaning will keep her looking her best
